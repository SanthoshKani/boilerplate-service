Hi All,

As we move closer to GA we need to start utilizing the CAF Release process as detailed in the following diagram:

 

What this means for us is:
* We should not have any “release” builds of containers in the docker-dev-local repo only snapshot builds.
* Once a container is ready for testing it should be promoted to docker-preprod-local where it will be QA tested and then released, so snapshot and release build can reside here.
* These released containers should then be copied up to docker-stablebuild-local repo from which Aspen should be consuming them.

There is some more information in the documents below but this doesn’t fit completely with us as this is more relevant to Aspen.


    
Comments on this are welcome to see how we can implement this.

Thanks
