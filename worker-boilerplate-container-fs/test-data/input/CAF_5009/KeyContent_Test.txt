If I understand it right using subtrees is basically having a copy of
the files in the central repository – again I think it would cause more
confusion than it would solve (with the code being is multiple places
and the merges that need to take place etc.)

I found this article on using subtrees instead of submodules, not sure
if it is of use but thought I would share anyway:

We can try it but my gut feeling is that it that would be complex to
manage and actually cause more confusion than it solves – because (1) it
will make it look like the projects are missing if you don’t use a
particular git clone option, and (2) any updates make when you browse
through to the sub-module will not automatically appear when you browse
again because the main projects is still linked to a particular earlier
commit.

Apologies for taking a ridiculous amount of time to reply.

 

This looks nice, I’m wondering if we should consider using sub modules
to tie snapshots of the dependent repos into a release of the umbrella
repo. Dermot what do you think? Unnecessary?

Hi All,

 

When you get a minute take a look at this repository?

https://github.hpe.com/michael-bryson/caf-audit-management-service

 

I have put this together as an example of what we could do with the
umbrella repositories in GitHub. Basically the idea is to give a brief
overview of the feature, in this case Auditing and each of the
constituent components involved. There are links directly to the
component projects so they are easy to find as well as a link the
testcases for the feature. The Jenkins build status is also shown for
each of the components.

 

We could then add release notes etc. to this top level as we are
releasing a full feature in most cases rather than components. We should
still maintain detailed documentation on the individual components but
with this top level it makes it easier to find.

 

This is not a final draft so let me know what you think and if there is
other stuff you think we could add here.

 

Thanks
