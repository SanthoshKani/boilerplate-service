Subject: GitHub Umbrella repository

 

Hi All,

 

When you get a minute take a look at this repository?

https://github.hpe.com/michael-bryson/caf-audit-management-service

 

I have put this together as an example of what we could do with the
umbrella repositories in GitHub. Basically the idea is to give a brief
overview of the feature, in this case Auditing and each of the
constituent components involved. There are links directly to the
component projects so they are easy to find as well as a link the
testcases for the feature. The Jenkins build status is also shown for
each of the components.

 

We could then add release notes etc. to this top level as we are
releasing a full feature in most cases rather than components. We should
still maintain detailed documentation on the individual components but
with this top level it makes it easier to find.

 

This is not a final draft so let me know what you think and if there is
other stuff you think we could add here.

 

Thanks
