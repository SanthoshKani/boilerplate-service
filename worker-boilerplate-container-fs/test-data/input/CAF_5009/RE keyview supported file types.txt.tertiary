Hi Sylvain,

                The attached lists from pg193-224 the formats (and
level of support) in KeyView.

 

I hope this is sufficient.

 

Thanks

Andy

Sure…we will copy accordingly…that will be helpful indeed…

 

Currently observed in Aspen that nsf and ost archive files are not
getting extracted…I assume nsf extraction needs lotus notes
configuration…not sure how it should work in Linux box (we earlier did
in Windows box)…

 

 

WR,

Shubhendu

Shubhendhu, you can probably share the data set and list of issues
encountered so far?
